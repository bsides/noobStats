This is my attempt to create a block of important attributes. 

The information for Specific roles (tanks, dps, healers) are changed on the fly in case you change talent or character.
Yes they are all in the paperdoll, except the CTC and Avoidance for the tank roles. I just find it more useable to use a Data Broker and just mouseover to get these stats. It looks good with Fortress :)

It's localized into english and portuguese only. If you want to localize it, please contact me.
Pictures are in portuguese because my client is in portuguese.

It makes use of LibDataBroker by Tekkub. Meaning: you'll need a Data Display Addon to make it work. Check this link out for more: https://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wiki/Addons-using-LDB in the section "Data Display addons"
